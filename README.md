## Description
The Thornberry Adventure Agency website is an online platform that describes the service, team members, and contact options of the Thornberry Adventure Agency, a travel agency specialising in unique adventure tours in the wildest of destinations. The website provides users with information about the agency's adventure tours and helps them plan their next exciting journey.

## Planning
### The Brief
We were given the task of creating an Agency website which contained the following criteria:

- An introduction to your agency
- Information about each member of your team
- A way to get in touch if they are interested in working with you

The user story specified the site needed to include the following:  

- See information about each member of your team so that I can know who you are
- Browse your website on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- Click to navigate to different sections of your webpage
- Contact you to enquire about working with you
- Visit your website at a publicly accessible domain name
- Navigate your website using keyboard controls
- Hear my screen reader describe the content on your website
- A user cannot submit a form without filling out all of the mandatory fields (name, company name, email address)
- Information from the form doesnâ€™t get submitted until the user clicks a button

## Building 

We started by mocking up the design of our website on Figma, to give us a starting point:
